Code for [MD-SA2: optimizing Segment Anything 2 for multimodal, depth-aware brain tumor segmentation in sub-Saharan populations](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-medical-imaging/volume-12/issue-02/024007/MD-SA2--optimizing-Segment-Anything-2-for-multimodal-depth/10.1117/1.JMI.12.2.024007.full). 
 
The training script will be released at a later date. The goal of this repository is to provide a more streamlined implementation accessible to a wider audience, as compared to the original code which was not well compartmentalized. At some point I will try to port the implementation to a docker image to further simplify things. 

Please raise issues in the github repository if you are experiencing any errors.

Also, the option to use sam2-lora has been included (not originally part of the paper).
